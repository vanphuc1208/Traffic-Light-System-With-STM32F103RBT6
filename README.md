## General Information:
- Major components: Custom board with STM32F103RBT6 MCU (Clock is 64MHz)
- Supporting communication protocol: UART
- Purpose: The project simulates a two-way traffic signal system following key features:
    - Automatic mode: The system operates as normal. Green, yellow, and red are the light colors.
    - Manual mode: This option allows you to change the light colors by pressing a button.
    - Tuning mode: This option allows you to change the duration of the light timing.
    - Pedestrian scramble: Upon pressing the pedestrian's button, the light turns on and functions in opposition to the vehicle's light.
- Implementing 4 buttons:
    - Pedestrian Button: Turn on the pedestrian light.
    - Button 0: Switch between manual and automatic mode.
    - Button 1: Increase the value of time.
    - Button 2: Set the current value to be the time of a corresponding light color.
- Components' usage:
    - Two-way traffic light LEDs.
    - 4 buttons for setting modes.
    - UART communication to display information to the terminal.
    - One buzzer warning the time is running out when the pedestrian LED is turned ON.
- Ports connecting:
